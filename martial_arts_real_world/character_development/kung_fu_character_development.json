    "name": "Kung Fu in Kenya: Chinese martial art helps local youth overcome difficulties",
    "summary": "In Kenya, Chinese Kung Fu is helping young people overcome challenges like alcoholism, crime, and low academic performance. Ngaruiya Njoge, a Kung Fu master who began to teach the martial art 30 years ago, has been training across Kiambu County, where rates of youth alcoholism are high. Njoge’s efforts have extended into public schools, where over 4,000 students are learning Kung Fu through free programs in 24 schools. In Nairobi’s Kawangware area, Kung Fu master Kennedy Murimi also spends his weekends to train children and young adults. Murimi’s classes have made a profound impact on students like Aisha Faith and Elvis Munzaa. Despite limited funding and resources, Njoge, Murimi, and their teams still harbour the dream of building a replica of the Chinese Shaolin temple in Kenya.",
