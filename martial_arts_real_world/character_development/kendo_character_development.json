    "summary": "Descended from the swordsmanship of the samurai, kendo is a traditional way of fencing using a bamboo sword (shinai). Meaning “way of the sword,” kendo strives to achieve a unity of mind and body through physical and mental coordination. An after-school program begun by the Japan Center, the ASIJ Kendo Team includes students from grades 3 through 9. Utilizing a unique Jedi ranking and testing system, the activity promotes interest in this traditional martial art with a modern twist. This is Quinn’s story of why she decided to pick up the shinai and follow the way of the sword and how it has given her entry into a world of authentic Japanese culture.",
