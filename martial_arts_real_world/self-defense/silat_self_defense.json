    "summary": "I'm excited to team up with Ilan from Inside Fighting Channel @inside_fighting  to explore the rich heritage of Silat and its applications in self-defense. Grateful to @RIZEMMA  for supporting the event.  We'll compare and contrast Silat's unique strategies with Karate's proven methods, highlighting the benefits of each. Ilan's extensive background in cross-training in combat sports, traditional arts, and combatives,  brings a fresh perspective to this captivating discussion. Join us as we bridge the gap between traditional martial arts and modern self-defense as we juxtapose Silat and Karate together.",
